    <br>
    <b>Hoggestown Mystery Sphere Museum</b>
            <br>
            <p>Following the peak of the Hoggestown Sphere Phenomenon notoriety and public recognition, local Hoggestown pawnshop owner Leonard Coltranne plans the development of a museum and information center surrounding the phenomenon. Coltranne spent 1980-1991 gathering information and physical evidence collected for the museum, afterwards securing a building and putting up billboard advertising across Route 2.</p>
            <p>A month after the 1993 Incident, the official <i>Hoggestown Mystery Spheres Local Museum & Gift Shop</i> opened its doors. Coltranne hoped the museum would gain state/nation-wide attraction from the mystery of the spheres by compiling evidence, witness testimony, photos, and videos of the cases spanning 30-some years. After its opening, the museum received few visitors aside from local Connecticut tourists, only bringing in a handful of national tourists a quarter. Shoddy management by Coltranne and his associates resulted in a dissolution of marketing funds, causing the museum to slip deeper into obscurity. The final unfortunate incident was an electrical fire in 1995, destroying the building and much of the physical evidence acquired by Coltranne. Unable to recover financially, the museum is forced to shut down.</p>

    <div class="heading"><b>Theories</b></div>
    There have been many theories throughout the years of what the spheres actually are, what their purpose, or lack thereof, may be. Here is a summary of the most popular theories among Hoggestown residences and individuals interested in the phenomenon:
    <br>
    <br>
<b>Cold War</b>
<p>The very first case of a sphere appearing in Hoggestown occurred during the middle of the Cold War, where tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were high, and a great concern among American citizens. Any unknown entity, especially one that could be classified as any type of technology, was treated with massive suspicion and concern over the safety and privacy of American citizens, fearful of Soviet communists listening and taking over their lives. However, this theory was widely debunked following the Cold War scare.</p>
<b>US Military</b>
<p>Following the cold war and increasing distrust of the US government, the public shifted to believing the spheres were a form of US government/military surveillance equipment. The military bases of Groton and New Haven, Connecticut were thought to have some involvement, though those two coastal towns are in completely different counties from Hoggestown, a completely landlocked area. The idea that the spheres were some sort of advanced government technology was also widely debunked, after multiple failed attempts to test the spheres for radio waves, magnetic activity, or any sort of vibrational feedback that might act as a form of communication.</p>
<b>Alien</b>
<p>The bizarreness and seemingly pointless purpose of the spheres led many to the conclusion that its purpose could not be defined by earthly technology, but rather as alien technology. This also served as an explanation for the strange phenomenon or symptoms that occurred in some people who had come into contact with the sphere, the strange malfunctions the spheres cause in photography and audio capturing devices, and the bizarre patterning and material makeup of the spheres themselves. Though many view this theory as ridiculous, it can't fully be denied that the spheres do not seem of Earth.</p>
<b>Installation</b>
<p>The theory that most skeptics believe is the idea that the spheres are some sort of art installation or project. However, this does not explain the unexplainable material make up of the sphere, which has stumped investigators and scientists alike, or the strange symptoms. No individual has stepped forward to claim responsibility in creating the sphere or starting the Hoggestown Sphere Phenomenon fervor.</p>
